            Super Fun Retro is an application to gather information and feedback from your team about how your sprint
            went! Sprint Retrospectives are an awesome opportunity to get your team together and talk about what went
            well, what can you approve on and anything you should stop doing. As a manager, this can be important
            information to help create action items for future sprints. Super Fun Retro is easy, simple and of course
            fun to use!

            Using Super Fun Retro is easy! Simply create your retro and send the link that is generated out to your
            team. Your team members then login and can start entering in feedback in three different categories; Keep
            Doing, Stop Doing, and Start Doing. Each team member can then vote for any item they like. All feedback is
            anonymous to help encourage a safe and free environment to provide more honest feedback. Only the user who
            creates the Super Fun Retro will be able to acivate/disable the retro as well as edit, delete or generate a
            report.

            Absolutely nothing! It is free to use! No limits on how many people can sign up, no limits on how many
            retrospectives you can create, and no limits on how long you can use it! Other retro softwares out there
            charge you after a certain time period, which isn&apos;t really fun in my opinion.
